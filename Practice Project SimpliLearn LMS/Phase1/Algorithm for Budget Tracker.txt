Algorithm for Budget Tracker App:

1.Initialize necessary data structures:

	Create a HashMap to store monthly budgets (monthlyBudgets).
	Create a HashMap to store expenses (expenses).
	Create a HashMap to store budgetary logs (budgetLogs), where each log entry is identified by a unique integer key.

2.Start the main application loop:
	Display a welcome message and prompt the user to log in.

3.Login Process:
	Prompt the user for their username and password.
	Check if the provided username and password match the predefined admin credentials (ADMIN_USERNAME and ADMIN_PASSWORD).
	If the login is successful, proceed to the main menu; otherwise, repeat the login process.

	Budgetary Logs
	Change Password
	Exit
	Prompt the user to select an option.

5.Handle User Menu Selection:
  	Based on the user's choice, execute the corresponding function:
	setMonthlyBudget: Prompt the user for a month and budget amount, and update the monthlyBudgets HashMap.
	recordExpense: Prompt the user for expense details (category, amount, password), validate the password, check if the expense is within the budget, and record the expense in the expenses HashMap.
	viewBudgetaryLogs: Display sub-menu options for viewing budgetary logs:

	exit: Terminate the application.

6.Date-Wise Log Display:
	Prompt the user for a date.
	Check if logs exist for the provided date in the budgetLogs HashMap.
	If logs exist, display the logs (ID, date, category, amount, description).

7.Month-Wise Log Display:
	Prompt the user for a month number.
	Iterate through monthlyBudgets and retrieve logs for that month from the budgetLogs HashMap.
	Display the logs (ID, date, category, amount, description).

8.Total Budget Display:
	Calculate the monthly budget, total spending, and current budget.
	Display the calculated values.

9.Delete Budgetary Log:

	If logs exist, remove the logs for that month from budgetLogs.

10.Password Change:
	Prompt the user for the current password and a new password.
	Validate the current password against ADMIN_PASSWORD.
	If valid, update ADMIN_PASSWORD with the new password.

11.Exit the Application:
